NB: The main branch only has simple UI implentation. The fancier AoE2DE UI version you can find in the [development branch](https://github.com/cnordenb/aoe2civexplorer/tree/development).

## Description

Explore Age of Empires II civilisations by technology availability: mark the buildings, units and technologies a
civilisation must have or must lack, and see which civilisations fit. The page is available in the same 17 languages
as [aoe2techtree.net](https://aoe2techtree.net/), where its data comes from.

### But why?

The in-game tech tree and all existing third party tools I know of let you do one or both of two things:  
- browse tech availability by civilisations, one civilisation at a time.  
- browse civ availability by technologies, one technology at a time.  

aoe2civexplorer lets you explore civ availabilty by technologies, with all technologies and all civilisations simulateously. Find out easily which civs have a specific set of available and unavailable technologies, units, and buildings.

## Installation

aoe2civexplorer requires a server to run and cannot run locally from file due to using .json for data.
However, it is runnable offline (English only) with the html file aoe2civexplorer.html available in [releases](https://github.com/cnordenb/aoe2civexplorer/releases).

## Usage

Filter Age of Empires II civilisations by toggling technologies, units, or buildings. Exempli gratia, find out which civilisations have Arbalester with full upgrades, or which civilisations are missing a certain set of units or technologies. You can find units, technologies, and buildings by either searching for them or browsing the checkbox node tree.
